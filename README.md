# 🐾 Animal Image Classification using MobileNet (TensorFlow)

This project classifies animal images into 15 categories using **transfer learning** with **MobileNet** and **TensorFlow**. It demonstrates how to leverage pre-trained models for accurate and efficient image classification.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes **15 different animal classes**, such as:

- Cat
- Dog
- Horse
- Elephant
- Lion
- Tiger
- Monkey
- Bear
- Deer
- Giraffe  
*(and more...)*

Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) and augmented during training to improve model generalization.
